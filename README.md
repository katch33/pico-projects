My micropython programs for my pico!
<hr>
These are simple micropython programs I have writeen/modified from Pimoroni's example codes to learn a bit about microcontrolelrs and the micropython language. This repo is intended as a place I can store all my code in the even that I have to nuke and reset my device (as I did earlier today).
